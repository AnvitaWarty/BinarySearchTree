# BinarySearchTree
This program implements a Binary Tree. With this program, the user can enter a sequence of values and view pre-order, post-order,  and in-order tree traversals for the first time their binary tree is generated and after every change.  They can insert a value, delete a value, find the predecessor nodes, and find the successor nodes.
